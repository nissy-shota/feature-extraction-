Provide useful information on feature extraction

## Description

Feature extraction and feature creation are important sections to submit a good score in the field of machine learning and DeepLearning.  
Feature extraction methods often vary from domain to domain.   
This repository contains useful feature extraction methods with a focus on image recognition, object detection, video recognition, speech recognition, and signal processing.  
It will include citations from books and useful articles from the web.   
Please visit the cited sources for more details.  
For my research reasons, I plan to start with acoustic features.  

If you have an interesting feature extraction method, please send us a pull request.　　
If you find incorrect information or incorrect code in this repository, I would appreciate it if you could send me Issues or Pull Requests.　　

## Feature Work

I would like the feature extraction code to be a function that can be called from the Dataset class in Pytorch.
